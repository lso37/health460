title: "Workshop 4: biases"
teaching: 10
exercises: 20
questions:
- "What are the different forms of biases?"
- "How can we minimise bias?"
objectives:
- "Learn to spot different types of biases and deal with them"

keypoints:
- "Biases are systematic errors in study designs"
- "Biases should be eliminated at the stage of study designs"
- "Biases will drive the results of studies either towards the null or in unpredictable directions"

## Biases in studies
- Selection biases
- Response Biases


## Selection Bias
- Investigators have differently recruited the comparison groups
- Example: in a study on breast cancer and diet,
- cases recruited from cancer ward
- Controls recruited from healthy volunteers
- The comparison groups have to be as similar as possible
- Case control study:
- If the controls were to develop disease,
- They would be branded as cases
- How to ensure that you eliminate selection bias?
- Matching for case-control and cohort study
- Randomisation in Randomised controlled trials
- Blinding procedures in Randomised controlled trials

## Response Bias
- Difference in response patterns between:
- Comparison groups
- Example: In a case control study of breast cancer:
- Cases were more _accurate_ than controls:
- In terms of reporting their dietary patterns
- How should you eliminate response bias?
- Use objective measurements as much as you can
- If you use survey instrument, make sure
- It has been validated, and
- Establish its reliability statistics
- Train the interviewers
- Avoid self-administered instruments if possible

## Biases should be addressed prior to study commencement
